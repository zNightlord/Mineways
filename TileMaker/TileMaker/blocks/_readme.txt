This is where to put any block image PNG files from the "\assets\minecraft\textures\block" directory in a Minecraft resource pack in order to make terrainExt.png.

For 1.11 on, copy the barrier.png tile from "\assets\minecraft\textures\item(s)" to this main directory.

For 1.20 on, copy the decorated_pot_side.png tile in "\assets\minecraft\textures\entity\decorated_pot" to this main directory (NOT the subdirectory).

You will want to put the chest images ender.png, normal.png, normal_left.png, and normal_right.png (or normal_double.png, for resource packs for 1.14 and earlier) from your resource pack's "\assets\minecraft\textures\entity\chest" directory into the "chest" subdirectory here.

Similarly for decorated pots, you want to put the decorated_pot_base.png in the "\assets\minecraft\textures\entity\decorated_pot" directory into a "decorated_pot" subdirectory here.
